# Virtual-Enigma-Machine
An attempt to implement a virtual version of the (in)famous Enigma Machine of WW2

## Goal
A faithful replication of the machines operation, covering all known models and extensible with new variations and encoding wheels.

## Current Target
Limited to the Army and Airforce versions of the device, as the "Railway" (Bletchley Park "Rocket", et. al.), Swiss, Italian, Commercial and the Navy versions are proving hard to find adequate documentation for different features. To replicate the action of the "reflector" on all versions where it actually moves as the message is entered - as well as how things like the 'D' reflector function- more (and accurate) information is needed. And documentation of the reflectors, ETW and UKW wheels for all models outside the two mentioned versions is also needed.
